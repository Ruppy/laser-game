# Lights

Lights is a game about bringing light to dark places and reconnecting things. It's also a thoughtful essay on depression, it's causes and about inner contemplation.

## Requirements

* Unity Version: 2019.3.0f6

All assets and necessary files are already included. Just load the project and hit run.

## How to build

```
ctrl or cmd + b
```

If, after build, you have a buggy game, without boxes and/or texts, you have to
build the Addresseables menu first with:

```
Menus -> Window -> Asset Management -> Addressables -> Groups.
Then Build -> New Build -> Default Build Script (from the top bar).
```
